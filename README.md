This add-on allows redirecting of media references (e.g. `<img src="foo.png">`) to a subfolder in the add-on's folder.
I have thousands of screenshots used in my vocabulary cards (generated using [hoarder](https://github.com/abdnh/hoarder)) that I use for context and don't want to sync to AnkiWeb and waste bandwidth, so I wrote this add-on to allow me to put the screenshots in the add-on's folder but still be able to see them in the cards.

## Known Issues

-   [ ] Check Media is not aware of your extra media folder, so it'll report any files only existing there as missing. This may be fixed in the future.
